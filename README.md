I first added Apache Cordova local notifications plugin created by running the command 'cordova plugin add de.appplant.cordova.plugin.local-notification'. I then literally downloaded the latest release and copied the minified [ng-cordova file](https://github.com/makers-memoria/ionic-push/blob/master/www/js/ng-cordova.min.js). I require the [file](https://github.com/makers-memoria/ionic-push/blob/master/www/index.html#L19) in the index.html. I then injected the [ng-Cordova](https://github.com/makers-memoria/ionic-push/blob/master/www/js/app.js#L6) into the app.js file. By now i was ready to use the $cordovaLocalNotification command in the controller. So I injected the [command](https://github.com/makers-memoria/ionic-push/blob/master/www/js/app.js#L11) in the controller.
